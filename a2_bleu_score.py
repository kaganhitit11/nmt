def grouper(seq:Sequence[str], n:int) -> List:
    '''Extract all n-grams from a sequence

    An n-gram is a contiguous sub-sequence within `seq` of length `n`. This
    function extracts them (in order) from `seq`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : sequence
        A sequence of words or token ids representing a transcription.
    n : int
        The size of sub-sequence to extract.

    Returns
    -------
    ngrams : list
    '''
    ng = []
    for i in range(len(seq) - n + 1):
        ng.append(seq[i: i + n])
    return ng


def n_gram_precision(reference:Sequence[str], candidate:Sequence[str], n:int) -> float:
    '''Calculate the precision for a given order of n-gram

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)
    n : int
        The order of n-gram precision to calculate

    Returns
    -------
    p_n : float
        The n-gram precision. In the case that the candidate has length 0,
        `p_n` is 0.
    '''
    count = 0
    rg = grouper(reference, n)
    cg = grouper(candidate, n)

    for i in cg:
        if i in rg:
            count += 1

    if count == 0:
        return 0
    return count/len(cg)


def brevity_penalty(reference:Sequence[str], candidate:Sequence[str]) -> float:
    '''Calculate the brevity penalty between a reference and candidate

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)

    Returns
    -------
    BP : float
        The brevity penalty. In the case that the candidate transcription is
        of 0 length, `BP` is 0.
    '''
    if len(candidate) == 0:
        return 0
    bp = len(reference)/len(candidate)
    return exp(1 - bp) if bp >= 1 else 1.0


def BLEU_score(reference:Sequence[str], candidate:Sequence[str], n) -> float:
    '''Calculate the BLEU score

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)
    n : int
        The maximum order of n-gram precision to use in the calculations,
        inclusive. For example, ``n = 2`` implies both unigram and bigram
        precision will be accounted for, but not trigram.

    Returns
    -------
    bleu : float
        The BLEU score
    '''
    bleu = 1
    for i in range(n):
        bleu *= n_gram_precision(reference, candidate, i + 1)
    return (bleu ** (1/n)) * brevity_penalty(reference, candidate)
